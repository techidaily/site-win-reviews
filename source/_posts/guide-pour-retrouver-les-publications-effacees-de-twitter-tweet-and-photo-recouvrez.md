👉 **Note:** If your computer cannot run Windows normally, you can use the Symantec Recovery Disk CD to help you boot your computer. Depending on which version of the product you have purchased, Symantec Recovery Disk is either included on your product CD or as a separate CD. If you don't have a floppy drive, you can create a [Norton Ghost Bootable USB](https://tools.techidaily.com/ubackup/products/) instead.

### Clone Disk with Norton Ghost

1\. Connect your new hard drive to your computer.

2\. On the **Tools** page, click **Copy My Hard Drive** and follow the steps in the wizard to copy the drive.

👉 **Note:** The drivers that are used to run the hardware on one computer will likely not match the drivers on a second computer. So you’d better not use the Copy Drive feature to set up a hard drive that will be used in another computer.
