From the past few years, because of the sudden growth of internet users, the websites have also become vulnerable to various security threats. Millions of malware are released periodically on the web for different purposes like hacking, gathering information, hijacking legit websites for promoting irrelevant content, stealing user data, and sometimes asking for a ransom. Usually, people get a security solution for their systems but ignore it for their websites.

According to a leading IT security institute [AV-Test](https://www.av-test.org/en/statistics/malware/), every day, about 350,000 malware are released on the web, and the total number has reached more than a billion. Naturally, it has become challenging for website administrators to protect their sites from cybercriminals. 

Some websites ask their users to register themselves by submitting their personal pieces of information for using or buying their services. So, it is the responsibility of the web admin to keep up the trust shown by the users and protect their information at any cost.

In this guide, we would discuss some of the tools that website owners or managers can use to scan their sites for any malware threat or vulnerability. Some of these tools would also provide you information on where your site lacks in security and what actions you can take to make it more protected and trustworthy for the users.

## Sucuri SiteCheck

![Sucuri SiteCheck](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sucuri.jpg)

Sucuri SiteCheck is one of the most popular web security providers. It supports various web platforms such as WordPress, Magento, Joomla, Wix, and others. Sucuri provides you with an online site scanning tool called **SiteCheck.** 

This tool can scan your site for any malware, malicious text, injected SPAM. When the websites get hacked, they sometimes get blacklisted by the browsers or search engines to prevent users from visiting them. Sucuri would let you know your site’s blacklist status against Google, McAfee, Norton, Yandex, and others. 

Sucuri would also let you know whether the plugins and themes on your WordPress site are updated or not. It provides a free plugin for WordPress, which performs all the web tasks.

Sometimes even after getting the SSL certificate, some links on the site remain insecure and have not migrated to HTTPS from HTTP. Sucuri would check for the ‘insecure links’ on your site and inform you about any specific page or URL that is showing ‘not secure’ warning.

However, there is one problem with Sucuri. It entirely works on the signature-based or behavioral matching algorithm. That means if any new malware is arises which is all-together unrelated to the previous ones, then Sucuri would find it difficult to detect.

## Quttera

![Quttera](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Quttera.jpg)

Quttera is another excellent security tool that offers you free scanning of your website for security threats such as malware attacks, insecure external linkage, blacklist status of various browsers and search engines, malicious files on your site, and more.

The best thing about Quttera is, it works on Artificial Intelligence based engine to perform the website scans. You just have to type or paste the URL of your website, and a detailed report would be available for the analysis. 

Quttera supports the basic HTML/CSS, WordPress, Drupal, Jumla, and other platforms. It also has a dedicated malware detecting plugin for WordPress sites. It also has a comprehensive web monitoring and malware removal facility. 

However, Quttera has some disadvantages associated with it. Its free scanner cannot scan sites of size more than 20 MB. Other then this, if multiple users are simultaneously using the scanner, it would slow down the results.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

MalCare is WordPress specific web security checking tool. It is considered as the fastest malware detector, among others. It has been developed after extensive research and analysis on more than 240,000 WordPress websites over a period of more than two and a half years. 

Unlike most of the other scanner, MalCare does not rely on just signature detection. It can detect the latest and hard to find malware threats too. By using more than 100 signals to examine the website, it makes sure that no false detection occurs while scanning.

Usually, web malware checking tools uses your site’s server resources. This makes your site slow. But MalCare performs a scan using its own server, which ensures your site performance is not degraded in any way.

Another great thing is, you don’t have to perform the scan manually, MalCare would automatically schedule a daily scan for your website. And if you want to run a scan manually, you can do that too.

However, there is one problem with MalCare. As mentioned, it is only dedicated to WordPress sites.

## UpGuard Web Scan

![UpGuard Web Scan](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/UpGuard.jpg)

UpGuard is best known for investigating the security breaches on websites and prepare a detailed report on it. Leading tech blogs like Forbes publish many of its reports. Other than that, it also provides excellent cybersecurity for the websites.

It has listed some of the significant security parameters. While scanning, it would compare your site with those parameters and report to you if it finds any abnormality or malware on your site.

UpGuard also provides you with a security health rating after performing the whole scan on your website. If your website contains no malware, but still its rating is below 500, then it is vulnerable to the threats and not at all safe for getting the personal or sensitive information from users.

With the help of its detailed report, it can predict the type of hack or attack your website could be a victim of if care is not taken at the right time.

However, the downside is, Upguard Security tool is weak in detecting the latest or unknown threats. Also, its scanner is slow to produce a result.

## Astra Security

![Astra Security](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Astra.jpg)

Astra Security is a multipurpose web-based tool that comes in two variants – a free and a paid one. Apart from scanning for detecting the malware on your site, it can also be used for performing SEO checks on the site. The scanner can perform a single-click security audit, blacklist check, SEO spam check, and much more. 

The free malware scanner would check your site’s publicly available source codes and would report you about the malicious links, malware codes, and other threats present on your site. 

It can also detect malicious scripts, hidden cryptocurrency miners, and phishing scripts that are secretly hidden on your site.

Both the free scanners work brilliantly, but it is recommended to go for the premium scanner if you choose Astra Security.

It is because, unlike the free scanner, the paid scanner would have access to your site’s internal files and folders and would produce a more accurate result.

## Unmask Parasites

![Unmask Parasites](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Unmask-Parasites.png)

If you visit the Unmask Parasites’ website, you will find it quite minimalistic. But it provides a powerful malware scanner to catch the threats on your site.

When your site gets hacked, the hackers insert malicious links on the internal structures of the website. Unmask Parasites, as its name suggest, unmask those links and reveals them to you.

On your pages or posts, you might have added the external links. If those links are contaminated, then Unmask Parasite would catch them.

However, the problem with Unmask Parasites is, it totally relies on signature-based detection. That means it can only catch known malware. Also, sometimes it can list clean codes as malicious.
