## Avast Internet Security

Avast offers a wide range of security service. It provides multiple layers of protection from antivirus and antimalware. Avast Internet Security has an active firewall level protection, which is essential for real-time attack blocking. It also has a good performance on spam filtering as it did not block any valid emails.The security suite accurately identifies safe and dangerous files. Avast Internet Security also offers decent real-time protection by scanning home networks.

However, there is a [considerable lag](http://www.toptenreviews.com/software/security/best-internet-security-suites-software/avast-review/) during active scans. While doing a full scan, it noticeably slowed the computer down. It is quite challenging to browse, open applications, and copy and transfers files when a scan is happening. It also interferes with more demanding programs such as video games. Additionally, the free version offers insufficient features compared to most full suite antivirus and anti-malware.

## Avira

Avira Antivirus is a full suite security program. Its strength lies in its antivirus detection and removal. However, it has improved its malware protection since its development. It has high results in several [independent laboratory tests](https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2426657,00.asp). Its malware blocking, which includes spyware, was recorded at 97 percent. It is also one of the most user-friendly security applications around. Additionally, Avira Antivirus offers more features in its free edition than other security suites.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Avira-e1508754236193.png)

Its strength in malware detection did not translate to removal. It did not wholly remove detected malware applications which can open your computer to further risks. Additionally, its Web Protection is only available for Firefox and Chrome. It is also considerably weaker than other web protection services.

## AVG

AVG Antivirus is known to be one of the best free security programs around. Even in its free edition, it showed significant results in different [laboratory tests](http://www.toptenreviews.com/software/security/best-antivirus-software/avg-review/). It does necessary protection very well. It efficiently detects and removes malware. AVG can also identify possible keylogger applications which records information you typed in your keyboard. More importantly, it has a passive mode. It does not prompt you to remove other third-party security programs. You can use it as a second layer of protection alongside your primary antivirus and anti-malware.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AVG-e1508754284906.png)

Unfortunately, it significantly slows the computer down, especially during an active full scan. It requires a lot of resources which affects video playback and video games. Scan slows web surfing, using office programs, and transferring files. Full scans can also take longer compare to other security applications.[](http://web.archive.org/web/20220129092943/https://www.avg.com/en-us/homepage)

## Webroot

Webroot SecureAnywhere Internet Security uses slightly [different methods](http://www.toptenreviews.com/software/security/best-internet-security-suites-software/webroot-internet-security-review/) in computer security. It leverages cloud technology to provide adequate protection. Because of this, it offers fast and efficient scans. Additionally, it always downloads latest signatures of known spyware. It can identify malicious websites and blocks spyware exploits. Moreover, it also protects your login credentials using one master password.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Webroot-e1508754335581.jpg)

Because of its unique methods, it fails a lot of laboratory tests. No other existing security software entirely uses cloud technology, so comparing its effectivity is still challenging. It is one of the very few security programs that use cloud technology at its core. You have to be continuously connected to the Internet to take full advantage of the security features.

## Conclusion

New threats arise every day. Different versions of known viruses and malware are becoming more and more clever. However, infecting a computer starts with identifying its vulnerabilities. A spyware hides in your computer and actively waits for holes in your security.

Stopping an attack starts at the very beginning. Preventing primary threats is better than catching what goes through your security layer. That is why choosing the best anti-spyware is essential.

With so many options, you can choose the security program that best protects your computer from spyware. Understanding your browsing habits and what threats lurk on the Internet is vital in deciding which antivirus and anti-malware suite to install. At the end, whichever security application you use, keeping things updated and regular scanning can protect you from any potential threats.
