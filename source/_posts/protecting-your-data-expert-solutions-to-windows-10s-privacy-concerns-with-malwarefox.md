Nahh I’ll stick to the classic settings with my account, I think that Cortana is awesome and I’m looking forward to all of the other features.

   Same, I just can’t understand why so many people freak out at the functions of Windows 10.

         I cant understand why people mindlessly give up their freedom and trusts to people they don’t even know and have never met. It will be fun to watch when an employee goes rogue and extorts the lot of you.

I think that I’ll go with the private method, I don’t really need the store or Cortana as they are not that useful to me.

   That’s your reason for putting your privacy at risk? Fun? You’re a weird one my friend, but who am I to judge?

I heard that the creators update will be even worse for privacy, is that true?

   As far as I saw from the insider previews it is actually better because it gives you even more privacy options.

Google does it and not one person bats an eye, Microsoft does it and everyone loses their mind. Get real.

   The two of them are kinda different though. You won’t rely on your phone for the same things that you would on your desktop/laptop, so the privacy on computers can be a problem for a number of people.
