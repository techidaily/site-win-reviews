## Is it Possible to Remove Facebook Completely?

![How to Remove Facebook from Life](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/How-to-Remove-Facebook-from-Life.jpg)

Yes, it is possible. You can easily do it. You can delete your account from Facebook and can never turn back. It only depends on your willpower. I have seen many people who ditch Facebook, even if they deleted their account, but after a few days, they return. That’s why Facebook doesn’t immediately delete your account 😀 It gives you the time of 30 days to rethink and if you want to come back you won’t have to start again.

You should also think if you want to completely stop it or just want a break of a few days. If you want to stop using Facebook for a few days until your exams are over, the best option for you is to deactivate your account. However, if you are worried that Facebook is spying on you and you don’t want to share your data anymore. Then you should delete your account.

If you request to delete your account, Facebook will delete all your data. However, it is not a guarantee that third-party services will also do that. The other websites or services you logged in with the Facebook account will still have your information. If you want to remove all those data then you will have to contact them separately. So, this task is going to be hectic.

When you delete your account, the other services you used to log in with Facebook might not work. You may have to contact those services to reinstate your account and provide you alternate login method. Although most websites have an alternate login method, it is not going to be a big problem.

Also, before removing Facebook from your life, you should ensure that is there any other service that works only with Facebook login. If there is such a service that you use, you won’t be able to access that service.

## Temporary Solution: Deactivate Facebook Account?

If you are not sure that you will stay away from Facebook forever, then you should deactivate your account instead of deleting it. This way you won’t lose your photos, posts, videos, and other activities. Other people on Facebook won’t be able to locate your profile.

Deactivating the Facebook account won’t affect the working of FB Messenger. Other people will be able to search you by name and send you the message. Your profile picture will also be visible. You can even log in to other services with the Facebook login method.

If Facebook is distracting you and you need to focus on a particular task for some time? Then this option is best for you. Follow the below steps to temporarily deactivate your Facebook account.

**1.** Click on the down arrow button and then click on **Settings**.

## How to Replace Facebook Activity?

Now you have removed Facebook from your life. Now it’s time to tackle the effect. The first 30 days are going to be tough. You are going to miss the activity on Facebook. Let’s see how your life will be after removing Facebook.

### Who will care for you?

You interact with many people on Facebook. Even your feeling sick status gets a single sad reaction, it gives you a feeling that someone is there that cares for you. Most people advocate that Facebook likes and reactions are not real. But that’s not true, people who like and react to your status are real. It tells that people who react to your status have seen it and they care for you.

You are going to miss it, there is no better alternative where you can do that. You can not send text messages to all your friends telling you to have a running nose. Yes, there are several other social networks, but people that know you are not there. Even Instagram and WhatsApp are now Facebook property. So, you can not use that either if you don’t want to share your information with Facebook.

### How do you keep up to date with Friends and Family?

Most of us now are living apart from our families. To know what is happening, you open Facebook and get the status. All your friends and family are using Facebook and they post about everything. So it is easy for you to get up to date with friends and family. When you will leave Facebook, it is not going to be that much simpler.

If you try to shift to another social network then you will not find your friends there. The second most active social network after Facebook is Twitter. But that is filled with intellectual people and it is rare that all your friends post everything on Twitter. If you look at Instagram, then again you will be giving your data to Facebook. It is the same with WhatsApp.

Facebook either acquires other rising social networks or destroys them as we have seen with Snapchat. So it is not going to be easy for you to find a replacement.

### How do you Message Friends and Family?

The time of sending SMS to friends and family is long gone. No one sends SMS these days. When you will ditch Facebook, sending messages to friends and family is going to be tough for you. You can use SMS, but if you are living abroad then it is going to cost you a lot. The most popular messaging platform is WhatsApp, which is Facebook property.

There are some other alternatives like [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org/)but you won’t find that many people using it. If your group of friends and family uses iPhone then iMessage is a great alternative for you.

### How do you Participate in a Team or Group?

Since most people use Facebook, it is easier to participate in the group. Facebook also makes it easier, it has lots of features in the groups. Whether it is your gym group or society, everyone prefers communicating with Facebook groups. When you leave Facebook, you are going to miss this feature. There are no better alternatives to Facebook groups.

However, there are some alternatives that you can use like [GroupMe](https://groupme.com/). It helps you to create groups and share posts and photos. Similarly, [Teamer](https://teamer.net/)is a good alternative to managing a team. It lets you communicate, organize, and collect money.

### How do you Login Securely to other Services?

No one wants to remember and types passwords. However, people want a secure method to log in to different services. The Facebook login method does this job. That’s why various internet services provide the Facebook login method. It is another thing that Facebook might have to use your data, but Facebook login has proved to be secured in the past.

If you have decided to leave Facebook then you can take the help of [password managers](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) to log in securely. Password manager lets you create strong passwords and auto-fills on the login forms. They also store your credentials in an encrypted vault so that no one can access them.
