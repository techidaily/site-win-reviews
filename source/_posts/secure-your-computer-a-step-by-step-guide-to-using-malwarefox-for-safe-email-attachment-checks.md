## **Protect Yourself From Malware in Email**

The basic rules of protecting yourself from viruses and malware from email attachment still apply to this day. Make sure that you can trust the sender of the email. However, double check the email address as viruses are known to use existing contacts in your email to send itself.

Also, be aware of file types which are commonly used as carriers of infected files. Watch out for _.exe, .pdf, .rtf, .vbs, .doc,_ and _.xls_ attachment especially if it is from an unknown source. These file types are known carriers of [worms](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) and malware. On the other hand, _.pdf, .jpg, .zip, .doc_ and other related file types are also popular tools for targeted attacks. 

The malware automatically activates when you open these files on your computer. Some may even start scanning your device for vulnerabilities right after downloading them.

Luckily, most if not all modern email providers have built-in virus and malware scanners to protect you from threats. These functionalities scan incoming and outgoing emails for any questionable files in them. For instance, [Gmail](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/25760?hl=en) automatically rejects emails and notifies the sender when it detects threats. It prevents the threat from reaching your inbox.

## **Scan Using VirusTotal**

In case you still receive an email, and its attachment looks fishy, you can screen the email and its attachments with VirusTotal without having to download the files.

First, forward the questionable email to [scan@virustotal.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). In **Gmail**, click the triple dot menu on the upper right corner when you open the email. Choose _Forward_.

Enter [scan@virustotal.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) in the _To_ field. If you want to receive the VirusTotal Online Scanner results in plain text, write _SCAN_ in the subject line. Click the dropdown menu on the upper left corner and choose Edit subject. You can also type _SCAN+XML_ if you want to receive the results in XML format.
