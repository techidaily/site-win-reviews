## What is Amazonaws Virus?

Amazonaws virus is actually the pop-ups displayed by compromising the legitimate s3.amazonaws.com site. In most cases, there is an [adware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) or web extension that is causing unsolicited redirections and pop-ups. The pop-ups might also cause if any [browser hijacker](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) takes control of your browser. 

## How Amazonaws Virus enters my PC?

If you see the Amazonaws pop-up on your browsing screen, it might be because of one of the following reasons:

* You might have visited an infected website while looking for freeware or similar things on the internet.
* Your system might be infected with an adware program, which is causing irrelevant ads and pop-ups on your browsing screen.
* The browser you are using might be tainted with ill-disposed malware known as Browser Hijacker. A browser hijacker can take control of your browser’s settings and redirect you to infected sites.
* Many users blindly install the software programs without unchecking the bundled programs that come with the installer. Cybercriminals often introduce malware such as Adware and trojans through the bundled programs.

## What are the symptoms of the Amazonaws virus?

The Adware causing the Amazonaws virus pop-up is not manually installed by users into their system. It usually infiltrates the device through the bundled program, infected sites, drive-by download, and more. 

When your system gets infected by it, it will show the following signs:

* Default search engine, the home page, new tab redirection would change to some other webpage.
* While browsing, you will be redirected to irrelevant and untrustworthy websites and pop-ups.
* You see a lot of advertisements while browsing the internet.
* The system becomes slow and sluggish.
* Since the Amazonaws virus keeps running in the background, it would increase the RAM usage.
* CPU gets heated because of the continuous running of the application.

## How to remove Amazonaws Virus?

If you experience all or some of the signs mentioned in the previous section, your system is infected with an illegal Chromium browser. The Amazonaws virus usually enters your device after an Adware or a browser hijacker takes control of your browser’s settings. 

To remove the Chromium virus, you have to first catch and remove the culprit adware, extension, or browser hijacker, which is the root cause, and then remove the Amazonaws virus.

For that follow these steps:

### **Restart your PC in Safe Mode**

Windows Safe Mode is the perfect environment to find out and solve the critical errors in the system. In safe mode, only system programs and some crucial programs run. Safe mode would most likely kill the applications and files that try to run automatically on your system. Follow this guide to boot your Windows 10 PC in [**Safe Mode**](https://www.windowschimp.com/how-to-boot-windows-10-into-safe-mode/)**.**

### **Remove Web Extensions From Browser**

You might have accidentally installed a malicious browser web extension that is responsible for the Amazonaws virus.

If you have many web extensions installed in your Chrome browser, it is time to sort them out and at least disable, if not delete, the ones you rarely use. However, you must remove the useless web extensions instead of disabling them. Because, even after disabling them, they might use the CPU processing power while checking for updates and performing updates.

Here are the steps to manage the web extensions on the Chrome Browser:

1. Click on the three dots at the top-right corner.
2. Bring mouse cursor over **More tools** and from the extended menu choose **Extensions**.![Extensions settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Extensions-settings.png)
3. All the extensions would be on your screen
4. Look for the ones you want to disable or remove.![manage chrome extensions](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/manage-chrome-extensions.jpg)
