## What are the best soundproof curtains?

Soundproof curtains vary quite substantially in cost. The way to make sure you're comparing apples to apples is to ensure you know the dimensions of your windows and whether you'll need one panel or two. 

Unless the window is at least a few inches narrower than the width of the curtain, you'll typically want two panels so that you can fully cover the window and get the full soundproof benefits. Finally, make sure that if the curtain comes in a filmier, thinner version and a soundproof version, you're evaluating the soundproof one -- some curtains have nearly the same name but add "noise-reducing" somewhere in the name.

## Which soundproof curtains are right for you?

If you intend to use the soundproof curtain in an area where you entertain company or have paid careful attention to design, make sure that the curtain you choose fits the color and style of the room and has a good drape to it that works for your room. 

At the same time, it is also an option to choose any drape or curtain and include a soundproof curtain liner inside that you choose more for its thickness than for its beauty. Here are some of the ways that we see these different products stacking up as the best option.

## Factors to consider when buying soundproof curtains

If you're looking to invest in soundproof curtain, you should consider the following factors:

* **Sound:** The most important factor is whether a soundproof curtain will help block noise. There are other features typically associated with soundproof curtains, such as a thermal barrier or light barrier to help block out extra sound.
* **Weight:** It is critical that a soundproof curtain is not too heavy so it does not weigh down the support apparatus. The last thing you want is your curtain rod ripping out of the wall and causing you extra damage.
* **Features:** Take into consideration specialty elements, like how some curtains are available in room-sized panels that can be used to create convenient room-sized dividers, as well as the luxury and style of the fabric.
* **Design:** Curtains and drapes are chosen with both aesthetic and practical elements in mind, so pay attention to whether users say they enjoy the effect that the soundproofing features produced, as well as whether they thought the curtains looked good in the rooms where they were used.
* **Price:** Although not generally too expensive, the cost of soundproof curtains can vary based on factors like the manufacturer, material, and size. We found the best soundproof curtains range in price from $11 to $109, depending on the option you choose.

## How did we choose these soundproof curtains?

To compile this list of soundproof curtains, we considered user reviews on sites like Amazon and Target, as well as Reddit message boards and our personal experiences with soundproof and blackout curtains. We considered the factors above as well when making our final choices.

## Are soundproof curtains good for a home studio?

Soundproof curtains can absolutely make a positive impact on your home studio. They can block out exterior noises while keeping the good sounds inside. They are also better able to isolate noises so you can record all of the little nuances of your musicianship. In addition to their overall affordability, they are super easy to set up, so you can get them up and ready before your next session.

## What are the materials to look for in soundproof curtains?

There are many types of soundproof curtains out there, but not all of them may be designed to provide the best soundproofing for your area. Many of the best soundproof curtains are made of a polyester blend with thermal backing to provide extra noise reduction. However, there are some other heavier types of materials available such as the Amherst Velvet Noise Reducing Curtain that can provide even stronger protection. 

## Are soundproof curtains truly soundproof?

While all of the curtains featured mentioned promise to be either soundproof or noise-reducing, all have reviews mentioning that the curtains act more as a sound dampener rather than full-proof sound-blocker.

If you're concerned that the sounds you want to dampen are too loud, be aware that no particular curtain is going to protect against all noise -- not even the wall of your home is able to do that in most cases. 

Instead, aim for curtains that will act a bit more of as a damper and allow less noise through, and then consider other options like adding insulation to your home if you worry that you're still hearing far too much.

## Can soundproof curtains reduce your energy bill?

Soundproof curtains and indeed curtains of any kind add additional protection against heat and cooling loss that can happen through both poorly sealed windows and single-pane windows. While you may not notice a change in your energy bill with only one new curtain, adding and using soundproof thermal curtains throughout your home could have a noticeable impact on how easily your home cools and heats, as well as your bill if all else is held equal.

## Do people sleep better if they have soundproof curtains?

Most people startle if outside noise is loud or sharp enough at night, so a sound-dampening or reducing curtain can make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep even with outside noises. However, adding a white noise machine may also be beneficial to your sleep if you find that unpredictable sounds are still rousing you from sleep. 

## Are there alternative soundproof curtains worth considering?

Both companies, Wontex and Nicetown, offer high-quality curtains that help muffle sounds, making them two additional options to evaluate. 

Wontex curtains are thick and weighted so they hang straight, and they are made with fabric on both sides and a middle high-density layer that works to block extra sound, heat, and light. Nicetown curtains are soft despite also featuring a triple-layer design all while being soundproof and fade-resistant. 

[Best blackout curtain alternative Wontex Blackout Curtains These heavy and soft blackout curtains are made of a triple-weave blackout fabric that blocks out 85% to 99% of light.
