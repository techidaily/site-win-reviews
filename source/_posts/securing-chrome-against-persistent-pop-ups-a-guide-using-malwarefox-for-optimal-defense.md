## What is a Pop-Up Virus in Chrome?

Pop-up ads are basically meant for the businesses to inform their customers of the new product release, latest offers, new happening, and more. It is quite a cost-effective advertising tool for companies, especially for new startups and enterprises.

However, in recent times the reputation of the pop-ups is totally maligned. Cybercriminals vigorously exploit this feature of the browsers and use it to infect the users’ computers with [malicious programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)and files. Clicking on any of the malicious sites’ pop-ups can infect your system with malware, or you would be redirected to the webpages that silently inject the ill-disposed files in the background.

Today, for most users, pop-up ads are nothing but the irritating entities that spoil their web browsing experience.

## Why Do Pop-ups Keep Appearing on My Chrome?

As already mentioned, there could be both legitimate and illegitimate reasons for the pop-ups to appear on the Chrome web browser. The valid reasons could be:

* If you have visited a product site, then a pop-up can appear asking you to buy the product or providing you the discount offers.
* While you are any blog site, a pop-up may emerge, asking you to subscribe to the newsletter.
* When you are reading any blog post, a pop-up may pop at the end that may ask you to share the post with others.
* Based on your browsing experience, search history, or saved cookies, related pop-up ads can appear.

However, there could be several wrong reasons that can trigger the pop-up appearance.

* There could be an [Adware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) installed on your system that is continuously popping irrelevant ads for generating revenues through pay per click.
* You might have visited any malicious site that is bombarding your browser with pop-up ads.
* It is also possible that a [browser hijacker](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) has compromised your browser, causing the irrelevant pop-ups.

## Final Words

Pop-ups are not that harmful to the system; however, continuous bombarding can frustrate the user and deteriorate the workflow. Further, it can also slow down browsing. Ultimately, it is up to the user whether they want pop-ups from some legit site or not.

**1\. Can I enable pop-ups for specific sites?** 

YES. On Google Chrome, you can enable pop-ups for the specific sites for which you are sure that they are safe.

**2\. Can my PC get a virus just by clicking on the pop-up?** 

Technically, your system can’t get a virus just by clicking on the pop-up. However, clicking on the malicious pop-up can initiate the process of virus or malware attack on your browser.
