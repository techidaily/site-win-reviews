## What is Rootkit?

A rootkit is a ​malware​ designed to hide in your computer and cause harm by staying under the radar. “Root” comes from the administrator account on Linux systems which allow​s root-level changes, i.e. command of the core processes of the computer system. “Kit” refers to the collection of programs that can be used to access this account.

A rootkit is essentially a stealth malware. So, it stays ​inside computer system undetected and serves as a [backdoor](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) for the [hacker](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). It can be used to steal or modify your personal files, change the login credentials, install and conceal other [types of malware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) on your computer, etc.

## Where do​ Rootkits come From?

Rootkits can intrude your computer through the same channels as the other types of malware. Examples include malicious emails, instant messages, illegal websites, etc. You can also accidentally download them on your system by installing software from unofficial sources, or by installing pirated software. This is because many times such software are tampered with and when you install the actual software, you also install a rootkit without knowing.

## How to Recognize Rootkit?

Rootkits are more dangerous than other malware because they are engineered to observe a furtive behaviour, an otherwise herculean task made easy by obtaining access to the system files and system settings.

Rootkits can remain undetected for weeks or even months. Since they load before the actual OS boots, they can modify the system to suit their requirements easily.

While the standard malware programs make themselves apparent by corrupting or locking your files or showing unrecognized ads in your web browser, etc. a rootkit requires a high level of attention for you to detect them.

One tell-tale sign of a rootkit infection, however, is that any antivirus program that is currently running on your system is disabled for no particular reason. This is actually a defence mechanism triggered by a rootkit so that it’s not identified as a threat by your computer.

Another common symptom is when the computer settings such as date/time, etc. change all of a sudden, or unfamiliar programs are installed on your system (identified through new shortcuts on the desktop, programs pinned to the taskbar), etc.

## How to Remove Rootkit?

As mentioned above, a rootkit is more powerful than most malware programs today because it can exploit high level of controls i.e. administrator privileges. However, there are many things you can do to get rid of it.

One way to remove rootkit is to update your antivirus program (you may need to activate it first if it’s disabled by the rootkit itself) and then run a deep scan. You can also check the list of programs installed on the computer and uninstall the ones you don’t recognize.

Some programs may not be listed in the control panel. However, you can find these by opening task manager and checking for the suspicious programs that are running in real-time.

The ideal way to get rid of rootkit completely and in the simplest manner possible is to use a specialized software program such as the Rootkit Remover by MalwareFox. It’s designed to identify and remove all kinds of rootkits and also close the backdoors that hackers might be using to access your computer. Its database is also updated regularly for maximum protection.

## How to Protect from Rootkit?

You can protect your computer from rootkits by avoiding opening suspicious emails or other forms of text messages, especially the ones that ask you to open a link, installing software only from reliable sources, keeping your antivirus programs and OS up to date, etc.
