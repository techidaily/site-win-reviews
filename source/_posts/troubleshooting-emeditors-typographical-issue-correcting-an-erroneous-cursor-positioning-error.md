Take the following text file for example, using Emeditor 9.05.

 1> Clicking at the end of the first line and holding on, then dragging to left, the words “dram” will disappear!  
 I wonder whether it is a common problem.  
 2> When clicking at the middle of a tab character, the cursor will appear at the beginning (see the 1st line) or sometimes the end (see the 2nd line) of that tab.  
 Though small bugs, they diminish the joy of using Emeditor in slight and subtle ways. :-?

 You might want to change a font to a non-proportional font. I realize this is an issue when selecting a line contaning tabs.  
 Thanks!
