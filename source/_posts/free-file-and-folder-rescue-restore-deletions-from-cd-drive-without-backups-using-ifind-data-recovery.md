After starting the free-to-use software, two recovery options will appear for selection: “Lost File Recovery” and “Lost Partition Recovery.” These enable you to tailor the recovery process based on whether your loss involves individual files being accidentally deleted, missing partitions that cannot be located or corrupted partitions which no longer boot properly.
