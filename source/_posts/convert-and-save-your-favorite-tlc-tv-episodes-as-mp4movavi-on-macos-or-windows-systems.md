## Convert and Save Your Favorite TLC TV Episodes as MP4/MOV/AVI on macOS or Windows Systems

### Overview

TLC is an American basic cable and satellite television network. And just like other American basic cable and satellite television networks, watching TLC TV shows has some limitations, for example:

* TLC TV shows can only be streamed online, but not offline.
* Watching TLC TV shows, especially the episodes, needs you to sign in with a supported TV provider.
* TLC TV shows are not always available on TLC website, but have some expiration date.
* TLC TV shows are not available outside of U.S. domestic Internet services.

But sometimes, there must be some users who want to have an offline enjoyment of TLC TV shows, or some users who do not have a supported TV provider but still want to enjoy TLC TV shows, or some users who want to enjoy TLC TV shows at sometime after the expiration date, or some users who live outside or U.S. but still want to enjoy TLC TV shows. What will these users do? Now a professional TLC TV downloader - Allavsoft can help users with any of the above questions.
