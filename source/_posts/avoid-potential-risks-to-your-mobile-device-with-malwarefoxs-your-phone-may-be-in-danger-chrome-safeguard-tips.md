## FAQs

**Can Google Detect Virus?** 

Google’s cybersecurity technologies are good, but they are not as good as antivirus solutions in finding malware.

Your phone is not really in Danger. Your browser might have been compromised, or you might have unknowingly agreed to get such dubious notifications from a harmful website.
